                    <p>Francisco Jos√© de Goya y Lucientes was a Spanish painter and printmaker. He is considered the most important Spanish artist of the late 18th and early 19th centuries. His paintings, drawings, and engravings reflected historical disorder and influenced important 19th and 20th century painters. He began his apprenticeship at fourteen, where his talent was quickly recognized. He had a severe and undiagnosed illness in 1793 which left him deaf, causing his work to go from lighthearted (see: The Straw Manikin) to  progressively darker and pessimistic (see: Saturn Devouring His Son.)</p>
